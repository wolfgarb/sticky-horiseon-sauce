# sticky-horiseon-sauce
## Overview

Here you will find my updated code for the refactoring code challenge. 
I took the original code and made improvements to make it more accesible and readable, by consolidating repetitive lines of code and ommitting pieces that were unnecessary to the functionality of the webpage. 
Below are links to my updated code and the original code for reference:
